# Artificial Intelligence Study
This is a simple study on artificial intelligence using a winner tree. The purpose of this study is to get familiarity with a simple game AI algorithm as well as memory usage, data structures, and general C programming tactics. There will also be some emphasis on geneeral software engineering practices. 

## Code Segments
The project will be broken into a few logical segments that will be described here as they begin development. This is to encapsulate functionality and ease in development. This will also help isolate and fix bugs easily.  
 
### Map
The map will be square and contain the tokens X, Y, and whitespace. While Xs and Os are standard, Xs and Ys will be used because math, and why not (very adult reasoning). Map functions will encapsulate allocating a map, deleting a map, traversing a map, setting map state, creating map strings, and comparing two maps.
